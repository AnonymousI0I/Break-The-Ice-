    <h1>Ice Breaker</h1>
    <h2>Equillibrium</h2>
    <h2>Why Are Glaciers melting?</h2>
    <p>Glaciers around the world are melting rapidly due to human activities that have increased greenhouse gas emissions, especially since the industrial revolution. These emissions have raised global temperatures, particularly at the poles, causing glaciers to melt, calve off into the sea, and retreat on land. Even with significant efforts to curb emissions, over a third of the world's glaciers are expected to melt by the year 2100..</p>
    <h2>What Can We Do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce carbon emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power.</li>
        <li>Advocate for stronger climate policies and support elected officials who prioritize environmental protection.</li>
        <li>Conserve energy at home by using energy-efficient appliances and reducing unnecessary electricity use.</li>
        <li>Support reforestation projects that absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Raise awareness about the importance of protecting glaciers and the broader environment through education and activism.</li>     
    </ul>
